Abstract:

TODO

#+END_NOTES

* Context
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
 - Philippe Coval <https://purl.org/rzr>
 - Professional "OpenSource" Engineer
   - Intel, Samsung, Huawei, [[https://www.silabs.com/about-us/corporate-responsibility][SiliconLabs]]
 - Volunteering FLOSS and DIY communities
 - Not a lawyer (but I learn everyday)
 - Invited by https://MyHumanKit.org/
  - For a "Libre licenses" conference

* Topics
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
 - Background, Origins, Motivations
 - Cooperation, Hardware, Software, patents...
 - Practical use cases

* Origin
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
  - Problems need Solutions
    - (not the other way around)
  - Problems are annoying people
    - EVERYTIME (and potentially EVERYONE)
  - Solutions require SOME investment
    - time/money spent ONCE
  - Solutions can generate some business
    - (and the other way around?)

* From Limitations...
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
  - Solutions can be costly, temporary
    - can cause more problems
  - No solutions fit every problems but can be
    - improved, optimized
    - customized, adapted, repurposed
    - combined, extended

* ... To Evolution
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
  - Improvement require more energy:
  - time & money
  - knowledge (sources)
  - Skills, materials, Tools
  - Help?
  - PERMISSION

* Commons tragedy
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
  - Everyone want to reuse others work
  - Nobody want to work for others
  - High Risk: Enclosure, dry up
  - Low Risk: try/hope and gain experience

* Motivations
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
  - Maximize result(s) / Minimize effort
  - Cooperation can make it possible
  - share a same goal
  - needs trust, fairness and respect
    - between everyone, now and later
  - Need Relationship commitment
    - on short and longer term

* Licensing
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
  - Agreement is a social contract:
    - Some rights (power)
    - Some duties (responsibilities)
  - Some respected rules are needed
    - Desire for "Peaceful Harmony"
    - Fear of "Far West" or "Jungle Law"
  - Tool to enable cooperation and derived works

* Software example
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
   - 1950s: "Sources sharing" was default
   - 1970s:  "*Proprietary* binaries" appeared
     - New Frustration problems
   - 1973: BSD (Berkeley Unix) source
   - 1983: RMS: user *freedoms*, GNU project
     - GPL: Execute, Read, Modify, Redistribute
   - 1992: Linux kernel under GPL
   - 1997: OpenSource (OSI): coop *methodology*
   - *FLOSS*: Free Libre OpenSource: Proven

* Patents example
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
  - Sharing solutions
    - divulging secrets
    - reuse is conditioned by fees
    - until it reach public domain
  - Or creating blocking problems ?
    - Repeatives fees for each country
    - IP: property, rents

* Subtilities
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
  - Reciprocal (Copyleft): Prefer cooperation
  - Permissive: Prefer reuse
  - Debian (DFSG, Social contract)
    - Permit use of "optional" unfree parts
  - Creative Commons:
     - can restrict commercial use, derivation
  - Beware/Avoid unclear terms:
    - "Public domain", "Libre de droit"
    - "Free", "Libre", "Open Hardware", "Remix"

* Strategies
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
  - Define and focus added value
    - your work or your expertise?
  - Find business model
    - Integration in Product, Services...
  - NIH: Do not reinvent the squared wheel
    - Consume Open Source
  - Produce Open Source or not
  - If compatible Derive/Combine OS

* How to start ?
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
  - Try to contribute to existing licensed project
  - Before creating original work
    - Assign one license sooner that later
  - And THEN publish your works
    - Authors and license will remain

* Choosing license ?
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
  - Depends on context and priorities
  - What you want ?
    - in short term or longer term
  - What you can ?
    - combining other works
  - What others wants/can ?
  - Learn from established orgs
    - FSF, OSI, LF/SPDX, OSHW
  - https://spdx.org/licenses/

* Open Source Hardware
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
  - [[https://oshwa.org/resources/open-source-hardware-definition/][OSGW Definition]]: 12 criteria
  - Documentation including design files
    - allow modification and distribution
  - Necessary Software: FLOSS friendly
  - Derived Works, Free redistribution
  - Attribution
  - No Discrimination, Restriction on use

* Case study CERN-OHL
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
  - [[https://spdx.org/licenses/CERN-OHL-1.1][CERN-OHL-1.1]]: 1st version
  - [[https://spdx.org/licenses/CERN-OHL-1.2][CERN-OHL-1.2]]: fix for derived works
  - Not single solution to several problems:
    - [[https://spdx.org/licenses/CERN-OHL-P-2.0][CERN-OHL-P-2.0]]: Permissive
    - [[https://spdx.org/licenses/CERN-OHL-S-2.0][CERN-OHL-S-2.0]]: Strongly Reciprocal
    - [[https://spdx.org/licenses/CERN-OHL-W-2.0][CERN-OHL-W-2.0]]: Weakly Reciprocal

* Hints for Makers
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
  - Learn for others, align to what works
  - Learn from SW experiences
    - Beware of concentration of power
  - Licensing in AI paradigm?
    - Is machine-learning copying ?
    - Is a model a derived work ?
  - More to win by giving control than keeping it
  - Protect your AND your community interests
