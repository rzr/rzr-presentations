## Title

From Oniro Blueprints for IoT devices

## Subtitle

Open-source seeds to products.

## Abstract

In the Eclipse Oniro project, a distributed OS for consumer electronics,
we're proposing a collection of "blueprints" use cases and their implementations
using embedded software on reference hardware.

Today, we are going to explain our motivations for the blueprints' approach
and of course how to replicate and deploy firmware from sources and
why Oniro can be flexible to create the device of your dream.

## Description

Oniro is an ambitious Eclipse project,
one of its challenges is to defragment existing IoT ecosystems.

To target a bigger heterogeneous range of IoT devices,
openness, flexibility, and interoperability,
should be enabled at the Operating System level.

Since the beginning of this versatile OS development,
a complementary blueprint concept was introduced
to be more aligned with different aspects of the software and hardware industry.

Blueprints are standalone projects that are addressing specific uses cases
by providing "semi final integration" that would make use of the underneath technology.

Those minimal viable products are not only used for demonstration or validation purposes,
but they can serve as a base to create production-ready solutions.
Blueprints also could inspire devices makers to address similar or more sophisticated use cases.

Today as we speak, our reference blueprints include
a vending machine, an IoT gateway, a door lock, keypad and more.

The results of our work are going to be demonstrated and we will be presenting
what is common and what differs.

Each of those achievements are targeting different uses case and different environments,
but many steps can be factorized from building process, customization to
security or IP compliance scanning.

Expect to see demos on how our Oniro project leverages other opensource projects
like Yocto/OE Embedded distribution, Linux and Zephyr Kernel, LVGL UI toolkit,
OpenThread mesh networking, Web of Things and more.

  TODO: Short demo video , may be better on v8
  Script:
  - If we like to move the VM display app to MC
    - in theory : we could rebase on different kernel (zephyr) but versions are not yet aligned
    - so wrote an other app for keypad blueprint
      - this app is connected using BLE
      - any volunteer to write bridge to vm's controller app?
